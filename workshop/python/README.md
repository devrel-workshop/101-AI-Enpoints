### ü§ñ Module 1: Chat bot with AI Endpoints üí¨

The goal of this module is to develop a simple chat bot with AI Endpoints and Python.  
To simplify some actions (REST request / UI), we'll use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/).

Go to folder [python/chat-bot/](../../python/chat-bot) to have all the source code and refer to the dedicated [documentation](./chat-bot-exercice.md) to do the lab.
